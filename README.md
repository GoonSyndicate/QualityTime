### ChatGPT Prompt:
As an expert React developer with specialization in NextJS, Tailwind CSS, ThreeJS, and TypeScript, assist in building a Progressive Web Application (PWA) for a virtual pet game. The main feature will be a ThreeJS panel where the user can interact with a virtual pet, which includes feeding it, petting it, dressing it, and watching its behaviors in its environment. The pet's status should change based on the user's actions or inactions. The game interface should be minimalist and lend itself to natural interactions with the pet. Additionally, the user should be able to access a profile with game stats and various settings. Provide expert level code examples, explain all steps, and troubleshoot code, with a particular emphasis on understanding and using ThreeJS. We already have a codebase set up, so we will proceed once you acknowledge this message and provide some ThreeJS tips to start us off.

- Nothing is hidden from you, so you have the freedom to make the necessary adjustments to fit your needs and preferences.
- Minimal code
- SEO-friendly
- 🚀 Production-ready

### Requirements

- Node.js 14+ and npm

### Getting started

Run the following command on your local environment:

```shell
cd Documents
git clone https://github.com/GoonSyndicate/QualityTime
cd QualityTime
npm install
```

Then, you can run locally in development mode with live reload:

```shell
npm run dev
```

Open http://localhost:3000 with your favorite browser to see your project.

```shell
.

└── tsconfig.json                   # TypeScript configuration
```

### Customization

You can easily configure Next js Boilerplate by making a search in the whole project with `FIXME:` for making quick customization. Here is some of the most important files to customize:

- `public/apple-touch-icon.png`, `public/favicon.ico`, `public/favicon-16x16.png` and `public/favicon-32x32.png`: your website favicon, you can generate from https://favicon.io/favicon-converter/
- `src/styles/global.css`: your CSS file using Tailwind CSS
- `src/utils/AppConfig.ts`: configuration file
- `src/templates/Main.tsx`: default theme
- `next-sitemap.config.js`: sitemap configuration


### Commit Message Format

The project enforces [Conventional Commits](https://www.conventionalcommits.org/) specification. This means that all your commit messages must be formatted according to the specification. To help you write commit messages, the project uses [Commitizen](https://github.com/commitizen/cz-cli), an interactive CLI that guides you through the commit process. To use it, run the following command:

```shell
npm run commit
```

One of the benefits of using Conventional Commits is that it allows us to automatically generate a `CHANGELOG` file. It also allows us to automatically determine the next version number based on the types of commits that are included in a release.

### Deploy to production

You can see the results locally in production mode with:

```shell
$ npm run build
$ npm run start
```

The generated HTML and CSS files are minified (built-in feature from Next js). It will also removed unused CSS from [Tailwind CSS](https://tailwindcss.com).

You can create an optimized production build with:

```shell
npm run build-prod
```

Now, your blog is ready to be deployed. All generated files are located at `out` folder, which you can deploy with any hosting service.

### Testing

All tests are colocated with the source code inside the same directory. So, it makes it easier to find them. Unfortunately, it is not possible with the `pages` folder which is used by Next.js for routing. So, what is why we have a `pages.test` folder to write tests from files located in `pages` folder.
